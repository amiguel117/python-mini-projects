# Caesar Cipher 

A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm in Python.

## How It Works
- The user chooses whether to **encode** (encrypt) or **decode** (decrypt) a message.
- The user provides a message and a shift number.
- Each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet by the given number to produce the encoded message.

## Features
- Converts all input to lowercase for consistency.
- Uses a fixed alphabet list for letter shifting.
- Simple and beginner-friendly example of encryption.

## Example
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:

encode
Type your message:
hello
Type the shift number:
5
Here is the encoded result: mjqqt



> Note: Current version only supports lowercase letters and encoding. Decoding logic can be added by reversing the shift.
